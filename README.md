GPS Tower Defense by ![](GPSTD_RM/GPSTD_RM/GPSTD_RMContent/brocket_small.png)
=================

GPSTD is a **location based** tower defense game for **Windows Phone 7** that was 
created during the **48-hour** [Great Canadian Appathon](http://www.greatcanadianappathon.com) competition
and placed **top 25**.

Our team was featured in the Financial Post and there's even a WIP screenshot of the app: http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/gca-microsoft-software-winning-fans-in-blackberrys-backyard

Enemies traverse the many paths on a bing map of your current location
and try to make their way towards you. You have to stop them dead in their tracks.

Made by four cool dudes fueled on energy drinks:
- **Graham Sharp** ([@pounddefine](https://github.com/pounddefine))
- **Kaylen Wheeler** ([@JvJ](https://github.com/JvJ))
- **Justin Masse** ([@justinmasse](https://github.com/justinmasse))
- **Dennis Ideler** ([@dideler](https://github.com/dideler))

Although the name only implies GPS, various other methods are used for estimating the user's location.

To get started, you'll need to install the [WP7 SDK](https://dev.windowsphone.com/en-US/downloadsdk).
